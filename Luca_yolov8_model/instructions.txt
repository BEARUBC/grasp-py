How to obtain the training and testing data:

    * The csv files included contain the information for all of the images from the Open Images dataset.

    1.  Look at class_is_dict.csv and decide which object you will train your model on. 
        (at the moment, I am only aware of how to train one object for a model)
        Copy the code for the class name. This is the class_id. Paste it into the variable class_id 
        in create_image_list_file.py and create_dataset_yolo_format.py

    2.  Run create_image_list_file.py
        This will create an image list with the information about the images you are trying to download. 
        You can change which images you download by changing the variable class_id to match the object
        class you are training for according to the file class_id_dict.csv
    
    2.  Execute downloader.py in the terminal
        python downloader.py image_list_file --download_folder=raw_data
        This will actually download all of the images contained in the image list from the previous 
        step into a folder called raw_data (these file names can be changed as long as they are consistent).
    
    3.  Run create_dataset_yolo_format.py 
        This will organize the data into the appropriate folders to begin the training process.


How to train the model:

    1. change the following parameters in config.yaml
        
        # path to the images folder
        path: C:\Users\lucab\OneDrive - UBC\UBC Bionics\ML small project\data

        # training images path
        train: images\train
        val: images\train

        # name of the class to be identified
        names:
            0: alpaca
    
    2. Run the following command in the terminal:

        yolo detect train model=yolov8n.yaml data=config.yaml epochs=1

        model = the base model to train
        data = the labels the model will be training + file path info
        epochs = increase to create a more precise model, but this will increase training time


How to test the model:

    Images:

        yolo detect predict model=./runs/detect/<train_number>/weights/last.pt source=./data/images/test/<image_name>

        <train_number> = Each time you train the model from the base yolov8n.pt, a new train folder is produced. This is the name of that folder
        <image_name> = File name of the image.
    
    Videos:

        create a folder called videos (if it does not already exist) and then run this command:

        yolo detect predict model=./runs/detect/<train_number>/weights/last.pt source=./videos/<video_name>

        <train_number> = Each time you train the model from the base yolov8n.pt, a new train folder is produced. This is the name of that folder
        <video_name> = File name of the video.
